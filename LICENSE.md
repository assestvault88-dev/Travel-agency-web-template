## 🚫 NO REFUND POLICY

Due to the nature of digital products, specifically templates, which are immediately accessible and non-returnable upon purchase, we strictly adhere to a **No Refund Policy**.

### 1. All Sales Are Final
* By purchasing a template from our shop, you agree that all purchases are non-refundable and non-exchangeable.
* Once the template file (or access link) has been delivered, the sale is considered final.

### 2. Why We Don't Offer Refunds
* **Irrevocable Digital Access**: The moment you download or gain access to the template, you have the full value of the product. Unlike physical goods, digital products cannot be "returned" in a state where they cannot be used.
* **Preventing Abuse**: This policy helps protect the intellectual property and prevents potential abuse where templates could be purchased, downloaded, and then refunded.

### 3. Exceptions (If Applicable)
* **Technical Errors**: We may consider a refund only if there is a documented and verifiable technical issue (e.g., the file is corrupted) that we are unable to fix within a reasonable timeframe.
* **Double Purchase**: If you accidentally purchase the exact same template twice, we will refund the duplicate purchase, provided you notify us within 7 days.

### 4. Customer Responsibility
* It is the customer's responsibility to read the full product description and confirm that the template meets their needs and is compatible with their intended software (Standard HTML/CSS/JS) before purchasing.
